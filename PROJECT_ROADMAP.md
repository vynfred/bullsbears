### Data Flow Architecture
1. **Backtesting Phase**: Historical data → Pattern recognition → Model training
2. **Daily Scanning**: Live data → Feature extraction → AI analysis → Alert generation
3. **Self-Training**: Alert outcomes → Performance evaluation → Model retraining
4. **User Interface**: Real-time alerts → Interactive dashboards → Performance tracking

## Critical Questions and Decisions ⚠️ IMMEDIATE ATTENTION REQUIRED

### Data Collection Strategy Questions
1. **Scale vs Speed**: Should we prioritize getting 6,961 stocks quickly or focus on data quality?
   - **Option A**: Process all 6,961 stocks in batches over 2-3 days (risk: API rate limits)
   - **Option B**: Start with top 1,000 most liquid stocks for faster iteration
   - **Recommendation**: Start with top 1,000, expand based on results

2. **Historical Data Depth**: How much historical data is optimal for training?
   - **Current**: 3 months (insufficient for ML training)
   - **Proposed**: 6 months (May-Nov 2024) for seasonal pattern capture
   - **Alternative**: 12 months for more robust training (higher cost/time)
   - **Question**: What's the minimum viable dataset for 60%+ accuracy?

3. **Data Storage Strategy**: How should we handle 4.5M+ data points efficiently?
   - **Option A**: PostgreSQL with optimized indexing (current approach)
   - **Option B**: Time-series database (InfluxDB) for better performance
   - **Option C**: Hybrid approach (PostgreSQL + Parquet files for historical data)
   - **Cost Consideration**: Storage costs vs query performance trade-offs

### ML Training Strategy Questions
4. **Training Data Balance**: How many events do we need for reliable ML models?
   - **Current**: 22 events from 50 stocks (insufficient)
   - **Target**: 500+ moon events, 1,000+ rug events
   - **Question**: Should we lower thresholds (15% moves) to get more training data?
   - **Risk**: Lower thresholds may reduce signal quality

5. **Model Complexity**: What's the optimal balance between accuracy and interpretability?
   - **Simple**: RandomForest (interpretable, fast training)
   - **Complex**: Neural networks (potentially higher accuracy, black box)
   - **Hybrid**: Ensemble methods combining multiple approaches
   - **Question**: Should we prioritize explainable AI for user trust?

6. **Real-time vs Batch Processing**: How should we handle daily scanning at scale?
   - **Current**: 200 tickers in 5 minutes (manageable)
   - **Scaled**: 6,961 tickers would take ~3 hours (too slow for daily scans)
   - **Solution**: Pre-filter to most volatile/liquid stocks for daily scanning
   - **Question**: What's the optimal daily scanning subset size?

### Resource and Timeline Questions
7. **API Cost Management**: How do we balance data quality with API costs?
   - **Databento**: Professional data but usage-based pricing
   - **Rate Limits**: Need to respect API limits to avoid service interruption
   - **Budget**: What's the acceptable monthly API cost for data collection?

8. **Development Priority**: Should we perfect the model or build the UI first?
   - **Option A**: Focus on ML accuracy before building user interface
   - **Option B**: Build MVP UI with current model for user feedback
   - **Question**: What's more valuable - perfect predictions or user validation?
