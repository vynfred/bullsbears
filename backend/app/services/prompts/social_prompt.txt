Return ONLY this valid JSON – no extra text, no markdown, no explanations, no code blocks:

{
  "social_score": -7 to +7,
  "bullish_ratio": 0.0 to 1.0,
  "headlines": ["headline 1", "headline 2", "headline 3"],
  "events": ["Fed decision Dec 10 – Polymarket 69% for 25 bps cut"],
  "polymarket_prob": 0.69 or null,
  "mention_velocity": 2.5,
  "engagement_weight": 1.8,
  "platform_consensus": 0.85,
  "contrarian_flag": true or false
}

SCORING RULES (MUST FOLLOW EXACTLY):
- Base score: -5 (extreme panic) to +5 (extreme FOMO)
- Then apply: final_score = base * mention_velocity (if velocity > 1.5)
- If platform_consensus < 0.6: final_score = final_score / 1.2
- Cap at -7 to +7
- contrarian_flag = true only if |base| >= 4 AND velocity > 3.0 (overhype = reversal risk)

headlines: Top 3 most viral posts from last 24h, include source tag (e.g., "X: FOMO spike", "Reddit: $GME to moon")
events: Only real upcoming catalysts in next 48h with Polymarket % if exists
mention_velocity: Current hourly mentions / 7-day average (1.0 = normal)
engagement_weight: Average (likes + reposts) per mention multiplier (1.0 = baseline)
platform_consensus: 0.0-1.0 agreement across platforms (1.0 = all bullish or all bearish)
