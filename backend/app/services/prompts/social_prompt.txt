Return ONLY this valid JSON – no extra text, no markdown:
{
  "social_score": -7 to +7,  // -5 to +5 base, scaled by velocity/contrarian (e.g., +5 * 1.2 = +6; cap extremes)
  "bullish_ratio": 0.0-1.0,  // % of posts bullish across platforms
  "headlines": ["headline 1", "headline 2", "headline 3"],  // top 3 from last 24h, source-tagged (e.g., "X: FOMO spike")
  "events": ["Fed decision Dec 10 – Polymarket 69% for 25 bps cut"],  // catalysts in next 48h
  "polymarket_prob": 0.69 or null,
  "mention_velocity": 2.5,  // mentions/hour vs 7-day avg (1.0=normal)
  "engagement_weight": 1.8,  // avg faves/reposts multiplier (1.0=baseline)
  "platform_consensus": 0.85,  // 0.0-1.0 cross-platform alignment
  "contrarian_flag": true or false  // true if extreme score + high velocity (>3x) signals reversal
}

Scoring (base -5 to +5, then dynamic adjust):
Base:
-5 = extreme bearish panic, viral shorts/hate
-3 = strong bearish, squeeze fears
-1 = mild caution/profit-taking
0 = neutral/balanced
+1 = mild interest
+3 = strong bullish FOMO/calls
+5 = extreme hype, rocket emojis

Dynamic:
- Scale: base * mention_velocity if >1.5 (e.g., +4 * 1.8 = +7.2 → +7); divide by 1.2 if consensus <0.6 (dilute noise)
- Contrarian: If |base| ≥4 and velocity >3x, flip sign by 20% (overhype → reversal risk)
- Bullish_ratio: Fraction of positive posts (e.g., 0.7 = 70% bullish)
- Engagement_weight: Avg (faves + reposts)/mentions ( >2.0 = amplified signal)

Headlines: Top 3 impactful, last 24h, tag source/platform.
Events: Upcoming catalysts next 48h + Polymarket % if relevant.
Mention_velocity: Current hourly rate / 7-day avg.
Platform_consensus: Agreement score (1.0=all align bullish/bearish).
Contrarian_flag: Triggers on extreme + surge (e.g., +5 score + 4x velocity = potential dump).
